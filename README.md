# Expense Splitter

A clean, object-oriented expense manager that supports Equal, Exact, and Percentage splits with a focus on scalable Low-Level Design (LLD).

Overview

The app tracks group expenses, computes who owes whom, and minimizes settlements. It’s designed to be easy to extend with new split types and notification channels.

Key Features

Split types: Equal · Exact · Percentage (plugged via strategies)

Minimal settlements: Custom greedy netting reduced inter-user payments by ~90% in test scenarios

Real-time updates: Observer-based notifications to 100% of group members on balance changes/transactions

Extensible design: Clear boundaries for adding new splits, payment methods, or UIs

Architecture & Patterns

Strategy – pluggable SplitStrategy for Equal/Exact/Percent

Observer – NotificationCenter pushes balance updates to users/channels

Factory – SplitFactory builds the right split from input

Singleton – Ledger (source of truth for balances)

Facade – ExpenseService exposes simple APIs to the UI/CLI
